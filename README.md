## How To Use
To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/JackJUson/Data-Structures.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd Data-Structures

# Go into the directory
$ cd Linked-Lists/Single

# Compile the code
$ gcc -o list.c program-name

# Run the code
$ ./program-name
```
> **Note**
> If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.
