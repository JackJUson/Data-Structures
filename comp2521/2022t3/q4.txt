Question 4

(a) How many words are stored in this trie? 11



(b) Which nodes would be visited in searching for "deeds"? d -> fail



(c) Explain what changes would be made in the trie if the word "bogus"
    was added.

    Node u would be added as a child of finishing Node g. Node s would 
    be added as a finishing node and as a child node of previously added Node u.

(d) Explain what changes would be made in the trie if the word "do" was
    added.

    Since the word "do" is a prefix of the prexisting word dog, the existing Node o
    would then become a finishing node. Node g would remain a finishing node.
