Question 2

Explain why the compilation error occurred and briefly describe how it
can be fixed.

The compilation error occurred because the program prog.c is 
dereferencing the struct graph that is not declared, since the
graph is an ADT.

This can be fixed by calling the graph edge insert function with the
vertices u and v as its input from the Graph.h interface. Instead
of directly calling the graph struct edges matrix.
