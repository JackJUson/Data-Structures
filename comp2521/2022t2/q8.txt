Question 8

Which of the given statements about tries (A, B, C or D) is false?
Briefly explain why the statement you selected is false.

A is false because searching for a word in a standard trie takes O(n),
where n is the AVERAGE word length, not the longest length.

B is false because finishing node can also have child nodes in a 
standard trie. This means that we can have prefix words within another word.
Such as "act" is a prefix and a word within a larger word "actor"
