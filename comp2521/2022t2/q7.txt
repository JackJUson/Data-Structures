Question 7

(a) How many items are examined in searching for the key 42? Justify
    your answer.

    4 items
    9 -> 20 -> 31 -> 42
    The hash function gives the index 9 for the key 42. Index 9 contains
    the items 9, 20, 31, 42, 53 and etc. Only 9, 20, 31 and 42 needs to be
    examined to find 42. Therefore 4 items are examined.

(b) How many items are examined in searching for the key 111? Justify
    your answer.

    10 items
    1 -> 12 -> 23 -> 34 -> 45 -> 56 -> 67 -> 78 -> 89 -> 100
    The has function gives the index 1 for the key 111. Index 1 contains
    the items 1, 12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89 and 100. The search would
    examine all the items and then condlue that 111 does not exist.
    Therefore 10 items examined.

(c) What is the worst-case search cost after N total items have been
    inserted? Justify your answer.

    Since we are inserting all the numbers from 1 to N, the items will be 
    uniformly distributed across all the indexes. Thus the longest chain
    length will be ceil(N/11). Hence worst case search cost in terms of
    the number of items examied is ceil(n/11).
