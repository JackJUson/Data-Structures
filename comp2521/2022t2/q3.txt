Question 3

(a) Which of the given sequences (A, B, C or D) would be produced by a
    valid post-order traversal of the same tree? Explain your answer.

    B
    Since post order traversal would produce the parent root of any
    subtree last before the left or right child, the first 3 values
    of the sequence has to be 2 8 7. Now in the first 3 values, 7 
    represents the parent node of left child 2 and right child 8 and
    we know this by the fact that pre order traversal which gave 
    16 10 7 2 AND THEN 8, and since pre order traversal traverses all
    the way down to the left most (smallest value of tree) leaf of 
    the tree, the root being 16 and all the way down to the smallest leaf 
    here being 2, indicating that 7 was the parent node of the leaf and 
    left child node 2. And also since 8 came after the smallest value
    2, this indicates that 8 is the right child of the parent node 7,
    since pre order traversal has to go to the right child after left.
    (Pre order = parent -> left child -> right child produce).

    By this evidence, post order traversal has to produce both its
    left and right child first before the parent, indicating that B 
    is the correct sequence since 2 and 8 are the child and 7 as parent.
    2 8 7 14 10 20 33 40 24 16

    According to the pre-order traversal, the tree contains the subtree
     7
    / \
   2   8
   The post-order traversal of this subtree is 2, 8, 7. Therefore, the 
   pre-order traversal of the whole tree should contain the subsequence
   2, 8, 7, but only option B contains this subsequence.
   Therefore the answer is B.

(b)

Value in the root node: 36

Value in the left child (of the root): 32

Value in the right child (of the root): 39

(c)

i.  Value(s) in the root node: 20

ii. Value(s) in the node that now contains 62: 35, 60, 62
