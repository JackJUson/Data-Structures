Question 5

(a) What is the difference between an Euler path and a Hamilton path?
    Euler path is a path on a graph that visits every edge of the graph exactly 
    once.
    Hamiltonian path is a path on a graph that visits every vertex of the graph 
    exactly once.

(b) Does the graph have any Euler paths? If so, give one of them. If not, explain why.
    There is no Euler path because the graph has more than 2 vertices of odd degree.


(c) Does the graph have any Hamilton paths? If so, give one of them. If not, explain why.
    Many Hamilton paths. One would be 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3.
