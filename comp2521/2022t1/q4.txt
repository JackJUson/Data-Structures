Question 4

(a) How many words are stored in this trie?
    11 words


(b) Which nodes would be visited in searching for "deeds"?
    Only the node 'd' would be visited.


(c) What new nodes would be created if the word "bogus" was added to the trie?
    Justify your answer.
    Since the word "bog" is already existing in the trie and also a prefix
    to the word "bogus", a child node of 'u' would be attached to the 
    finishing node of 'g' and the finishing node 's' would be added as a 
    child of the recently added node 'u'.

    Therefore only the node 'u' and finishing node 's' would be added to the
    trie.

(d) What new nodes would be created if the word "do" was added to the trie?
    Justify your answer.
    The word "do" is already a prefix of the existing word "dog" within the
    trie, therefore the node 'o' would become a finishing node and no other
    changes are necessary.
