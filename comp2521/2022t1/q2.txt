Question 2

What is the time complexity of the algorithm? Justify your answer.

O(ceil(log n)) => O(log n)

The while loop iterates through floor(n / 2) amount of times until n
becomes 0. Since the iteration of the while loop is halved each iteration,
and since all other computational operations are constant, this gives us
the time complexity of ceil(log n) which in Big O is O(log n).
