Question 3

(a) 
(a1) What value(s) would be stored in the root node of the above 2-3-4 
     tree after the insertion of the value 8? 
     Justify your answer.
     The root node contains 12, 35, 60.
     This is because 8 is smaller than 12 and since the left most
     child node of the root node does not yet contain 3 values, 8
     can therefore be stored in the left most child node.

(a2) What value(s) would be stored in the node that now contains 8? 
     Justify your answer. 
     The node containing 8 has 1, 7, 8.
     Since 8 is smaller than the smallest value of the root values 12,
     and also since the child node only contains 2 items. 8 can be stored
     with 1 and 7 to make a complete full node.

(b) 
(b1) What value(s) would be stored in the root node of the above 2-3-4 
     tree after the insertion of the value 50? 
     Justify your answer.
     The root node only contains the value 35.
     This is because when the value 50 is inserted, the child node
     containing 36, 44 and 57 becomes full with node 50 and brings
     the middle index value 44 up to the parent node. However since 
     the parent node is also completely full, the parent node itself
     brings the middle index value 35 up above its current level and
     sets 35 as the new root containing a left child node of 12 and a
     right child node containing 44 and 60.

(b2) What value(s) would be stored in the node that now contains 50? 
     Justify your answer.
     The node containing 50 has 50, 57.
     Since the original node before 50 was inserted was full with
     36, 44 and 57, after inserting 50, the middle index value which
     is 44 would be brought up leaving 36 split with 50 and 57.
