Question 1

What is the time complexity of the algorithm? Justify your answer.

O(n log n).

Since the problem of size n can be broken down into two subproblems n/2
, we can recursively break the two subproblems into individual subproblems
and then break them down into two subproblems until all problems become 
size one or zero. This step would require time complexity of O(log n) since 
the original problem of size n is divided by half continousuly. Then since
the combination of all these subproblems require a size of O(n), we have
n * log n. Hence the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n).
